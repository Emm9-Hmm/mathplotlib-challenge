#Objective
With the provided data the objective is to compare the different Drug Regimen, paying close attention to Capomulin, to discover its effectiveness

#Conclusions
With the provided tables and graphs, we can notice that the only two treatments that perform significantly better than Placebo are Capomulin, and Ramicane, we can see this in the summary table
We can also notice that Capomulin and Ramicane are the two treatments the most measuments have been made, which makes important to make sure the positive results are not the outcome of a biased study
We can see that the population of mice is evenly distributed among sex, however we haven't confirmed if that applies for each treatment, which could lead to biased results
We see that there are possible outliers in both Capomulin and Ramicane
We can notice that Capomulin gives positive results in every case in this study, which reafirms its efectiveness
We see a clear correlation between weight and the tumor volume, that advert us we have to make sure we have to have an evenly distributed population by weight in every treatment to make sure our conclusions are not biased
